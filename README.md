### ETS 2 Lane Detection

This is my first approach to lane detection in Euro Truck Simulator 2.
This program will capture a screen from selected monitor to identify 
lanes on the road while in game. It should run from the drivers seat with
default camera setting ``1``. It was set up for screen resolution 1920x1080. 
You can test it by dragging sample images in assets folder to the captured monitor.
